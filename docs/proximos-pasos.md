# 13\. Next steps

Although **nhopkg v0.5.1** is stable, there is room for growth.

## For package maintainers

  * Create more `.srcnho` packages
  * Improve split package definitions
  * Add reproducible build flags



## For core development

  * Automated test suite
  * Sandboxed builds
  * Man pages
